# Aho–Corasick Automaton

Build a trie-based multi-pattern search automaton with failure links.

## Tasks

- Construct a trie of all patterns.
- Compute failure links and output lists for each node.
- Run the automaton over a text stream to find all pattern occurrences.

## Suggested Languages

- Rust
- Go
- C++

## Real-World Use Cases

- Keyword or profanity filter for chat logs or user-generated content.
- Log scanning tool to detect known error signatures or patterns.
