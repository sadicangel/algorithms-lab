# Suffix Array + LCP

Build a suffix array for a string and compute LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array.

## Tasks

- Implement a suffix array construction algorithm (even O(n log^2 n) is fine to start).
- Implement Kasai’s algorithm to build the LCP array from the suffix array.
- Use the suffix array + LCP to answer substring and prefix queries.

## Suggested Languages

- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Implement a simple full-text search for a single large document.
- Build tools to find repeated substrings or measure similarity between texts.
