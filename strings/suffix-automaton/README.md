# Suffix Automaton

Implement a suffix automaton to represent all substrings of a string compactly.

## Tasks

- Build the automaton incrementally from a string.
- Implement operations to check if a substring exists and count distinct substrings.
- Extend to compute longest common substring of two strings.

## Suggested Languages

- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Similarity comparison between documents or source files.
- Tools that analyze repeated patterns or common substrings in code bases.

## References / Further Reading

- Explanatory blog posts and tutorials on suffix automata.
- Algorithm handbooks that cover automata-based string algorithms.
