# Prefix Function / Z-Function

Implement prefix-function (for KMP) and/or Z-function based pattern matching.

## Tasks

- Implement the prefix-function and a substring search based on it.
- Implement the Z-function and a substring search based on it.
- Compare correctness and performance against a naive search implementation.

## Suggested Languages

- C#
- Kotlin
- C++
- Go

## Real-World Use Cases

- Fast substring search in large text files or logs.
- Preprocessing patterns in a search tool or text processing pipeline.

## References / Further Reading

- Online articles describing the prefix-function and Z-function algorithms.
- Algorithm reference sites with examples of KMP and Z-function usage.
