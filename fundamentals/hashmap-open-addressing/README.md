# Hash Map (Open Addressing + Tombstones)

Implement a cache-friendly hash table that uses open addressing and tombstones instead of linked lists.

## Tasks

- Implement linear or quadratic probing, with tombstone markers for deletions.
- Support insert, lookup, delete, and resize operations.
- Measure how performance changes with different load factors and probing strategies.

## Suggested Languages

- C
- Zig
- Rust
- C++

## Real-World Use Cases

- Symbol table for a small language implementation or your own scripting engine.
- Fast in-memory cache for IDs or handles.
