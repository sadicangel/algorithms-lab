# Hash Map (Separate Chaining)

Implement a basic hash table using buckets of linked lists.

## Tasks

- Use strings or integers as keys and integers or small structs as values.
- Implement insert, lookup, delete, and resize when load factor exceeds a threshold.
- Experiment with different hash functions and load factors.

## Suggested Languages

- C
- C++
- C#
- Go

## Real-World Use Cases

- Word frequency counter for text files.
- Symbol table mapping variable names to information in an interpreter or compiler.
