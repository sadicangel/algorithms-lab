# Dynamic Array / Vector

Implement a growable array type with manual control over capacity and reallocations.

## Tasks

- Implement push, pop, insert-at, and remove-at operations.
- Grow capacity geometrically (e.g., 1.5x or 2x) when full.
- Expose size and capacity, and optionally a way to pre-reserve capacity.
- Write a small benchmark against the language's built-in dynamic array (if any).

## Suggested Languages

- C
- C++
- Zig
- C#
- Go

## Real-World Use Cases

- Use as the backing container for other data structures (stacks, queues, etc.).
- Use in a tiny JSON parser to store array elements and object fields.
