# Singly & Doubly Linked Lists

Implement basic list structures to understand pointer-based layouts and cache-unfriendly access patterns.

## Tasks

- Implement singly and doubly linked lists with append, prepend, insert, remove.
- Implement a simple iterator to traverse the list.
- Optionally implement a generic list using void* or templates/generics.

## Suggested Languages

- C
- C++
- Rust
- C#
- Kotlin

## Real-World Use Cases

- Model simple task queues or undo/redo stacks.
- Use as a teaching example for why contiguous arrays are usually faster.
