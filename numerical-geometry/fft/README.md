# Fast Fourier Transform

Implement the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm for complex inputs.

## Tasks

- Implement a recursive or iterative FFT for sizes that are powers of two.
- Implement the inverse FFT for reconstructing signals.
- Use FFT for convolution or a simple spectrum analyzer.

## Suggested Languages

- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Audio analysis (visualizing frequency spectrum).
- Fast polynomial multiplication or convolution operations.

## References / Further Reading

- Signal processing and FFT explanations in numerical analysis references.
- Online tutorials that walk through Cooley–Tukey FFT step-by-step.
