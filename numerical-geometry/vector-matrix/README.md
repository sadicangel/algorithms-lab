# Vector and Matrix Math

Implement basic 2D/3D vector and matrix types and operations.

## Tasks

- Implement vector add, subtract, dot product, cross product (3D).
- Implement 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 matrices with multiplication and transform functions.
- Use tight, contiguous storage to encourage good cache behavior.

## Suggested Languages

- C
- Zig
- C++
- C#

## Real-World Use Cases

- Game and graphics math for transforms, camera, and physics.
- Numerical simulations and geometric computations.
