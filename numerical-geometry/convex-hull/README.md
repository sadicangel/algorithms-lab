# Convex Hull (Monotone Chain)

Compute the convex hull of a set of 2D points using the monotone chain algorithm.

## Tasks

- Read a list of 2D points and compute their convex hull in O(n log n).
- Optionally visualize the result or print the hull in order.
- Handle degenerate cases (all points collinear, duplicates).

## Suggested Languages

- Go
- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Visualizing the outline of a set of points (e.g., geographic or clustered data).
- Preprocessing step for more advanced computational geometry tasks.
