# Bloom Filter

Implement a space-efficient probabilistic set that supports insert and membership queries.

## Tasks

- Use a bitset and multiple hash functions.
- Implement add and mightContain operations.
- Measure false-positive rates for different sizes and hash counts.

## Suggested Languages

- Rust
- C#
- Go

## Real-World Use Cases

- Check if an element is definitely not in a large set (e.g., caching layer).
- Pre-filtering expensive operations in network services or databases.
