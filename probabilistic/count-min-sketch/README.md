# Count–Min Sketch

Implement an approximate frequency counting structure for streaming data.

## Tasks

- Use a 2D array of counters and several hash functions.
- Implement add and estimate operations.
- Experiment with trade-offs between accuracy and memory usage.

## Suggested Languages

- Go
- Kotlin
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Track approximate request or URL frequencies in high-throughput systems.
- Analyze approximate word frequencies in a data stream.
