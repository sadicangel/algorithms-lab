# Algorithms Lab

A curated, long-term learning repository for exploring algorithms, data structures, 
systems fundamentals, compilers, functional programming concepts, concurrency, 
numerical methods, and more. Designed to help you broaden your knowledge by 
implementing classic and advanced techniques across multiple programming languages.

This repo is structured by **topic**, with each topic containing **specific projects**.  
Each project has its own folder with a `README.md` describing:

- What to implement  
- Suggested languages  
- Real-world use-cases  
- References and further reading  

No timelines, no rigid curriculum — pick anything, at any difficulty level, whenever you feel like it.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
algorithms-lab/
  fundamentals/
  strings/
  trees-graphs/
  concurrency-distributed/
  numerical-geometry/
  probabilistic/
  pl-compilers/
```

Each project folder is fully self-contained and can hold one or more implementations 
in the languages of your choice (C, C++, Rust, Zig, C3, C#, Kotlin, Go, OCaml, F#, etc.).

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong intuition for algorithms and data structures  
- Explore multiple paradigms (systems, functional, declarative, concurrent, distributed)  
- Learn by **implementing** instead of reading theory only  
- See how different languages shape your thinking  
- Build a reusable catalog of implementations you can rely on later

## 🌍 Philosophy

This repo is intentionally **language-agnostic**.

Every project can be implemented in any language you want — the folder structure 
doesn’t enforce language-specific subdirectories.  
If you want to write the same data structure in Rust, C#, Zig, and Go — great.  
If you prefer sticking to one or two languages — also great.

The goal is exploration, not completion.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

1. Browse the topics and pick something interesting (easy or complex).
2. Open the project folder and read its `README.md`.
3. Create your implementation inside that folder.
4. Optionally write benchmarks, tests, or visualizations.
5. Commit and move on to whatever interests you next.

There are intentionally **no deadlines**, **no correctness police**, and **no pressure**.

## 💡 Ideas for Extension

You can extend this repo by adding:

- GPU algorithms  
- Actor models (Erlang/Elixir)  
- Category theory examples  
- Database internals (B-Trees, WAL, MVCC)  
- Networking (TCP stack experiments, DNS, HTTP parser)  
- Distributed algorithms (Raft, gossip protocols)  

Anything that expands your understanding belongs here.
