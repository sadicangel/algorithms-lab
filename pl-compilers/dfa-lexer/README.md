# DFA-based Lexer

Build a lexer generator core using NFAs, DFAs, and DFA minimization.

## Tasks

- Define a small regex subset and construct NFAs from patterns.
- Convert the NFA to a DFA using subset construction.
- Minimize the DFA and use it to tokenize an input stream.

## Suggested Languages

- Rust
- Zig
- C

## Real-World Use Cases

- Core of a custom .lex-compatible lexer generator.
- Tokenizer for configuration files, simple languages, or domain-specific tools.
