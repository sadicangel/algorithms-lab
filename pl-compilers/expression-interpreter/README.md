# Expression Interpreter

Build a simple AST and interpreter for arithmetic and boolean expressions.

## Tasks

- Define an AST with literals, variables, and binary/unary operators.
- Parse a small expression language (via recursive descent or a parser generator).
- Evaluate expressions in an environment (mapping variable names to values).

## Suggested Languages

- OCaml
- F#
- C#
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Configuration or scripting expressions in a larger system.
- Foundation for building more advanced interpreters or DSLs.

## References / Further Reading

- Implementation notes from books on interpreters and compilers.
- Functional programming resources that show building small interpreters.
