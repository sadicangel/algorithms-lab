# Hindley–Milner Style Type Inference

Implement type inference for a tiny expression language using unification.

## Tasks

- Define an expression language with let-bindings and function application.
- Implement type variables, type schemes, and unification.
- Run algorithm W (or a variant) to infer principal types for expressions.

## Suggested Languages

- OCaml
- F#

## Real-World Use Cases

- Understand how ML-family languages infer types without annotations.
- Build foundations for more advanced type systems.
