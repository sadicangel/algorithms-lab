# Dijkstra and A* Pathfinding

Implement shortest path algorithms on weighted graphs, including heuristics for A*.

## Tasks

- Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm using a priority queue.
- Add A* with an admissible heuristic for grid or spatial graphs.
- Visualize or log the explored nodes to understand the search behavior.

## Suggested Languages

- Go
- Kotlin
- C++

## Real-World Use Cases

- Pathfinding in tile-based maps (games or simulations).
- Routing and dependency resolution in service graphs or build systems.

## References / Further Reading

- Algorithm references for Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms.
- Game AI and pathfinding articles that discuss heuristics and grid graphs.
