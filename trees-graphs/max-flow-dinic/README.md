# Max Flow with Dinic’s Algorithm

Implement Dinic’s algorithm for computing maximum flow in a directed graph.

## Tasks

- Implement level graph construction with BFS.
- Implement blocking flow computation with DFS over the level graph.
- Extend to solve bipartite matching problems via flow formulation.

## Suggested Languages

- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Task assignment and resource allocation problems modeled as flows.
- Network capacity planning or simple scheduling problems.

## References / Further Reading

- Algorithm texts that cover max-flow and Dinic’s algorithm.
- Competitive programming resources for max-flow and matching problems.
