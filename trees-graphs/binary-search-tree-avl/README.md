# Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree

Start with a basic binary search tree, then extend it to a self-balancing AVL tree.

## Tasks

- Implement insert, search, and delete for a plain BST, then for an AVL tree.
- Implement rotations (left, right, left-right, right-left) and height balancing.
- Compare the performance and height characteristics of BST vs AVL.

## Suggested Languages

- C#
- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- In-memory sorted index keyed by numeric or string keys.
- Order statistics (e.g., find k-th smallest element) with slight extensions.

## References / Further Reading

- Data structure textbooks or references on self-balancing search trees.
- Online AVL tree visualizations that explain rotations.
