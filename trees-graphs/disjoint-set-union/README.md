# Disjoint Set Union (Union–Find)

Implement a DSU structure with union-by-rank and path compression.

## Tasks

- Implement find with path compression and union with rank/size.
- Track number of connected components in a graph as edges are added.
- Use DSU as a building block inside other algorithms.

## Suggested Languages

- C
- Rust
- C#

## Real-World Use Cases

- Connected component queries in undirected graphs.
- Kruskal’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree.
- DFA state minimization in automata-based tools.
