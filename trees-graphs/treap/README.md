# Treap (Randomized BST)

Implement a treap, a binary search tree that maintains heap property on a random priority.

## Tasks

- Implement split and merge operations.
- Support insert, erase, search, and optional range queries.
- Compare simplicity and performance with AVL or red–black trees.

## Suggested Languages

- C++
- Rust

## Real-World Use Cases

- Ordered set or map with fast split/merge operations.
- Time-travel structures (persistent versions) when combined with persistence techniques.

- Algorithm resources that cover treaps and randomized data structures.
- Blog posts that illustrate treap usage and advantages.
